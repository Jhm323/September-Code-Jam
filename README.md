A small React app that generates a random cleaning challenge, created for the Software Engineering September 2025 Code Jam.  
Users can generate 3–5 cleaning tasks, check them off in a checklist, and track their progress with a progress bar.

## 👨‍💻 Project Vision/ Strech Items

This project is designed to be scalable, allowing the addition of pages that provide tidying tips for specific areas like **Room**, **Kitchen**, **Yard**, and **Neighborhood**.

The **Dust Progress Bar** visually represents the participant's progress. Inspired by the app's fishbowl theme, the concept envisions starting with murky water in the fishbowl, which becomes progressively cleaner as tasks are completed.
